# playdate-postbot

This is a community-specific fork of [discord_feedbot](https://github.com/freiheit/discord_feedbot) that will be extended to include role management and related messaging capabilities.

## Installation

Requires Python 3. Dependencies can be installed using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Settings for local testing are included in `feed2discord.local.ini`. When running in production this file should be omitted and replaced with `feed2discord.ini` with settings appropriate to the production environment.
