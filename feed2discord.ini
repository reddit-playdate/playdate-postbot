# Suppose you have one feed with different types of content, which you want to redirect posts to different channels
# Use python regex!
# Regex is done on the title field of the entry

# Channel one receives all entries which have a space-padded "MP3" or "AAC" in the title
one.filter =(\bMP3\b|\bAAC\b)
# Channel two receives all entries which do not have space-padded "MP3" or "AAC" in the title

# and all other rooms only get the OGG files...

# If a channel has no filter field, it always passes (yet to test)

# Consider a feed which provides a list of tags of a entry
# And that some users want to be notified of these posts
# Use the @ formatting!
fields = **title**,comments,@category,"------------------------------"
# @ format tag turns a field with a space-seperated list of tags into @mentions, provided the @[tag] role exists in the discord server
# For example, a entry with the list of tags "jazz, piano" will be turned into
# "<@&[id for jazz role]>, piano" provided a role @jazz exists
# and when posted it will mention everyone with the @jazz role, and print "@jazz, piano"

# Personal recommendation is to create user classes which DO NOT conflict with tag names
# And also create a user role which is able to modify their own role, hence modifying their subscriptions
# For example, a role hierarchy would be, in descending order:
# Admin, bots, special users, user (this is what you promote everyone to, probably automatically)
# (tag roles here) house, jazz, piano, dubstep
# (finally the @everyone) @everyone
